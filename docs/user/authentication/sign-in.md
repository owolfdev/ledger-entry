# Signing In to Your Account

Learn how to access your Ledger Entry account securely.

## How to Sign In

1. **Navigate to the Application**: Go to the Ledger Entry website
2. **Click Sign In**: Look for the "Sign In" button or link
3. **Enter Your Credentials**:
   - Email address (the one you used to create your account)
   - Password
4. **Click Sign In**: Submit the form to authenticate

## Sign-In Form Fields

### Email Address

- Enter the exact email address you used when creating your account
- This is case-sensitive and must match exactly
- Include the full email address (e.g., `user@example.com`)

### Password

- Enter your account password
- Passwords are case-sensitive
- If you've forgotten your password, use the [forgot password](forgot-password.md) feature

## After Signing In

Once you successfully sign in, you'll be redirected to:

1. **Dashboard**: Your main account overview
2. **Repository List**: View your existing ledger repositories
3. **Quick Actions**: Access common tasks like creating new repositories

## Staying Signed In

Ledger Entry uses secure session management:

- **Automatic Login**: You'll stay signed in until you explicitly sign out
- **Session Timeout**: For security, sessions expire after a period of inactivity
- **Cross-Device Access**: Sign in from multiple devices using the same credentials

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Credentials Error

If you see an "Invalid credentials" message:

1. **Check Email**: Ensure you're using the correct email address
2. **Check Password**: Verify your password is correct (case-sensitive)
3. **Reset Password**: Use the [forgot password](forgot-password.md) feature if needed
4. **Account Status**: Ensure your account is verified (check your email)

### Account Not Found

If you see an "Account not found" message:

- Verify you're using the correct email address
- Make sure you've completed the [sign-up process](sign-up.md)
- Check that you've verified your email address
- Try creating a new account if you haven't already

### Forgot Password

If you can't remember your password:

1. Click "Forgot Password" on the sign-in page
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your email for reset instructions
4. Follow the link to create a new password

## Security Best Practices

- **Never share your credentials** with anyone
- **Sign out** when using shared or public computers
- **Use strong passwords** that are unique to Ledger Entry
- **Keep your email account secure** as it's used for account recovery
- **Report suspicious activity** if you notice anything unusual

## Multiple Devices

You can access your account from multiple devices:

- **Same Credentials**: Use your email and password on any device
- **Automatic Sync**: Your data syncs across all signed-in devices
- **Security**: Each device maintains its own secure session
